VCF2CSV

As the name implies, this project's goal is to quickly and easily convert VCF/BCF files into CSV (or TSV) files.

Providing a python interface to achieve this was an important point, given how easy to use and flexible this language is.

The code of this VCF to CSV converter is mainly based off of this file from the source code of rust-bio-tools:
